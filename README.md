# Some-common-tips-for-taking-a-PoC-



Take a screenshot of everything. You might not need it but it’s better than to regret later.
Take relevant screenshots with only the required region. The developer doesn’t need to see your entire desktop and taskbar while you are trying to show him an XSS popup.
Make mute videos and use text editors to type instructions. It is much more convenient.
Write down every step of your process in your text editor, be it information gathering and the information you found, vulnerabilities found, interesting blogs/links that you read to find, test and exploit vulnerabilities, links to automate scripts/exploits you found online, data you found after exploitation, everything!
Use proper folder and file structure.
Make sure that this data is backed up and secure. Use Google Drive, Dropbox, Onedrive, etc. to constantly backup the screenshot folders and VAPT project folders to the cloud.
Also, make sure these are safe and secure, since if someone gets hold of this, he/she will be able to cause critical damage to the organisation and you will get into trouble.
